// What a member can switch OFF in Settings → Experimental — whole apps, and
// single features inside an app. One map, one localStorage blob, because it is
// one question: which parts of this workspace does this person want on screen?
//
// Outliers is the optional APP, and it ships ON (September 2026, Massimo's
// call): it shipped off on the reasoning that ad research is a side quest next
// to the production line, and enough members went looking for it that the tile
// is worth more than the row it costs. It stays in this list — switching it off
// takes the whole app, not just the tile: its dock entry, its card in
// Meet Your Workspace, and the Bank's Swipe File tab, which is Outliers' own
// bank and points at an app that isn't there without it.
//
// A default here is only the fallback for a member who has never touched the
// switch, so flipping it moves everyone who never opted out and nobody who did
// — a stored `false` is a real choice and outlives the default.
//
// B-Roll's Continuous mode is the optional FEATURE, and it ships OFF too: the
// keyframe chain is a second shape of workspace beside Line-by-Line, and for a
// member who only ever storyboards line by line the toggle above the inputs is
// a choice they make once and then pay for on every visit. Off hides the mode
// toggle, holds the app in Line-by-Line, and drops Continuous sessions out of
// History — there is no mode left to open one in, the same rule the retired
// One-Shot rows follow. Nothing is deleted: every keyframe, clip and history
// row is still on disk and in the cloud, and switching it back on restores all
// of them exactly where they were.
//
// Something NOT listed here is always on: this is a short opt-out list, not a
// permissions layer, so nothing can accidentally hide the production line.
//
// Per-browser, like the theme and the generation-info switch: its own
// localStorage key, never cloud-synced, and untouched by the sign-out wipe.
// This is a preference about a workspace, not account data — the cost being
// that a member who wants Outliers back switches it on once per browser.

// One-time opt-in resets. Flipping a `defaultOn` only moves a member who never
// touched that switch — a stored boolean is a real choice and outlives it — so
// turning something back on for EVERYONE takes a run listed here: the stored
// value for that id is dropped once per browser and the id falls back to its
// default above. It is a reset, not a lock: the very next flick of the switch
// writes a fresh choice that no later run can touch, because each run is
// remembered under its own marker key and never repeats.
//
// `discover` is here because Outliers came back on in September 2026 and the
// members asking for it are exactly the ones who had switched it off while it
// was a side quest; leaving their stored `false` in place would have hidden the
// flip from the people who wanted it.
