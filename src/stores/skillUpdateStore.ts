// member installs by hand, so a new version is invisible to anyone who already
// downloaded the last one — they have no reason to open Edit again. This store
// is the nudge: the dock tile dots and the folder wears a "New update" badge
// until Edit has been opened on the current version.
//
// Per browser on purpose (like the theme, never cloud-synced): the skill is
// installed into a Claude Code or Codex setup on THIS machine, so "already got
// it" is a fact about the machine, not about the account.

// Bump this whenever public/video-editor.skill is replaced, and update
// SKILL_FILE_SIZE + WHATS_NEW in EditStudio.tsx with it.
