// Single source of truth for the user-facing error text shown anywhere a
// generation/API call can fail. Every catch block that surfaces an error to a
// real user (toast, inline chip, history row) should run the caught value
// through humanizeError so the whole app speaks with one voice and users get a
// plain-English "here's what to do" line instead of a raw kie.ai 4xx/5xx dump.
//
// NOTE: This deliberately overrides the older CLAUDE.md "surface raw kie.ai
// response shape" rule for *end-user* surfaces — the operator asked for friendly
// copy so members stop forwarding raw errors as support questions. The raw text
// still lives in kie.ai's own request logs (which the operator reads) and in
// admin/settings/infra surfaces, which intentionally keep verbatim messages.

// Each rule matches case-insensitively against the raw error message. Order
// matters: most specific first, generic codes last. The first match wins.
