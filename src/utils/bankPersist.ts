// BrollHistoryItem carries whole session snapshots (`result`, `cardStates`, and
// the Continuous + retired One-Shot ones) and measures ~43 KB, so a capped-at-50
// bank is ~2 MB on its own. Add the rest of a working member's banks and the
// blob passes what Safari will take in one setItem, which threw
// QuotaExceededError on a browser holding a grand total of 0.44 MB — nowhere
// near full, just past the per-value ceiling. A row-count trim couldn't help
// (the fat bank never HAS many rows), and shedding rows was the wrong answer
// anyway: the cloud holds every one of them, so the local copy going hungry is
// a speed problem, never a data problem.
//
// IndexedDB has no comparable ceiling and the app already trusts it with the
// media blobs themselves. One record, one key.
