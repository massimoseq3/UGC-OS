  // money lit on fire. The Ad Analyzer is the one exception in the other
  // direction — it is pinned to STRONG, because it writes for a reader too and

  //
  // Order matters: Gemini 3.8 Flash is FIRST so it stays getDefaultModel's
  // candidates[0] fallback for any chat consumer without an explicit defaultFor.
  // The two PICKER apps hold INDEPENDENT slots and both currently default to
  // Gemini 3.8 Flash too (September 2026, the operator's call, taking the slots
  // from GPT 5.6 Terra) — see that entry. They have diverged before and can
  // again, which is the reason the slots are separate. A member who never opens
  // the picker now writes on the app-wide default rather than ~2.9× its
  // credits, and every dearer row is one click away in both.
  //
  // NOTHING in the blurbs may name a default — one picker component serves both
  // apps, so "the default" was true in one and a lie in the other the moment
  // these diverged. The panel's tick and the trigger row already say which model
  // is live where you are.

  // the same transport, which is the reason that swap was the safe one, but the
  // prompts are still tuned to a model no longer in the list. A stronger model

  // ── Image generation ──────────────────────────────────────────

  // Image models — pricing from kie.ai/{slug} marketing pages. Resolution
  // tiers map to the `resolution` cost param: '1K' (default), '2K', '4K'.
  //
  // ORDER IS THE APP-WIDE DEFAULT. `getDefaultModel` falls back to
  // `candidates[0]`, so whichever entry leads each mode's filtered list is what
  // an unpicked slot resolves to everywhere — and it is first in the picker for
  // the same reason. GPT Image 2.5 Sunburst leads for BOTH text-to-image and
  // image-to-image (its Edit sibling sits directly under it), which is why
  // there is no `defaultFor` on any image entry any more: Massimo asked for one
  // answer in every app, and a per-app pin is exactly how the answer quietly
  // stops being one. Nano Banana 2 held this position until September 2026 and
  // is one row down.
  // GPT Image 2.5 — OpenAI's September 2026 image release, on kie.ai as two
  // variants of one family. Flare is OpenAI's own default ("start with Flare
  // for most applications"); Sunburst trades generation time for tighter
  // control across edits. Each ships as its own text-to-image and
  // image-to-image kie slug, exactly like GPT Image 2 above, so the
  // `-image-to-image` sibling the ref-swap logic resolves to is right there in
  // the family. Body shape is identical to GPT Image 2's (prompt +
  // aspect_ratio + resolution + input_urls), which is why buildImageInput's
  // `startsWith('gpt-image-2')` branch already covers all four.
  //
  // Pricing: 6 / 10 / 16 credits at 1K / 2K / 4K, per image — the SAME rate
  // card GPT Image 2 sits on, one row up. kie.ai/pricing still printed "To be
  // announced." on all twelve tier rows when these were registered
  // (2026-09-09); the numbers here are Massimo's, off real billing, which is
  // also how GPT Image 2's 2K=10 was confirmed. Re-verify against
  // kie.ai/pricing once it fills in.
  //
  // `official` is the same $0.053 medium-quality 1024² estimate the GPT Image 2
  // pair carries, and it is NOT borrowed on a hunch: both 2.5 model pages state
  // the token rates outright ($5/M text in, $8/M image in, $30/M image out) and
  // then say so in as many words — "Token rates match GPT Image 2." Higher
  // tiers have no clean flat equivalent, so they return null and count as zero
  // savings rather than an invented discount.
  //
  // The two fields had to land TOGETHER, which is why the first cut shipped
  // with neither: `foldUsageEvent` computes savings as (official − kie), so an
  // official rate with no kie rate would have banked the whole $0.053 as money
  // saved on a generation the member actually paid an unknown amount for.

  // ── Video generation ──────────────────────────────────────────

  // Seedance 2.5 — ByteDance's next-gen video model. Two things separate it
  // from the 2.0 family:
  //
  //   1. Length. It generates up to 30s in one call, where the rest of the
  //      catalog tops out at 15. Hence the extended duration ladder below.
  //   2. Input shape. It is registered with NO first_frame_url /
  //      last_frame_url — every image arrives via `reference_image_urls` as a
  //      generic reference, not as frame one. Same situation as Gemini Omni: no
  //      'image-to-video' and no 'frames-to-video' mode, so B-Roll's Animate tab
  //      and Continuous grey it out rather than silently animating from a still
  //      it can't honour. A frame that reaches the body builder anyway rides
  //      along as a reference image (see buildVideoInput) rather than dropped —
  //      which is why `mixedImageInputs` is 'reference' and not the 'exclusive'
  //      the rest of the family carries.
  //
  //      NEEDS A LIVE CHECK (2026-08-15): docs.kie.ai/market/bytedance/
  //      seedance-2-5 now documents first_frame_url AND last_frame_url on this
  //      model ("last_frame_url cannot be passed alone; first_frame_url must be
  //      provided together with it"), which contradicts the above — either the
  //      slug gained them since it was registered in beta, or the original read
  //      was wrong. Declaring the two frame modes would un-grey it in Continuous
  //      and change how B-Roll animates a still on it, so it is deliberately NOT
  //      being changed off a docs read alone: fire one frames-to-video call at
  //      it first. Everything below is correct for the model as registered.
  //
  // Pricing (kie, beta — user-supplied 2026-08-07). kie publishes two tiers per
  // resolution and the cheaper one is NOT cheaper in practice:
  //   no video input:   480p 28/s · 720p 63/s, billed on OUTPUT seconds
  //   with video input: 480p 17/s · 720p 38/s, billed on (INPUT + OUTPUT)
  // A 5s reference clip on a 5s render is 17×10 = 170 credits at 480p, versus
  // 28×5 = 140 with no clip — so the "discount" tier costs more the moment the
  // reference is longer than ~⅔ of the output. We quote the no-video rate
  // across the board: it's exact for the common case, and we can't know a
  // reference clip's length at estimate time. Same floor caveat as MiniMax H3.
  // kie also notes prices are beta and the +10% top-up bonus makes the
  // effective rate ~10% lower — neither is modelled, since both move the real
  // figure DOWN and an estimate that over-quotes is the safe direction.
  //
  // No `official` / `market` entry, for the same reason as the whole Seedance
  // family: kie undercuts Fal but not BytePlus direct, so we claim no savings
  // rather than pick a flattering baseline.

  // renders faster and costs ~1.5x. They are registered as two plain entries
  // rather than one virtual id with a "fast" toggle, because the member picks a
  // renderer by name everywhere else in this app and a hidden speed switch
  // inside one row would be the only exception.
  //
  // 3.0 is a single slug that takes everything: first/last frame, up to 10
  // reference images, 5 reference clips, 5 reference audio tracks, and up to 30
  // seconds of output with native audio. (Wan 2.7 sat below these two as a
  // third Alibaba row, split across two mode-specific slugs behind one virtual
  // id, and was removed in September 2026 — 3.0 supersedes it on every axis.)
  //
  // Frames and reference IMAGES are mutually exclusive here — the docs say
  // reference_image_urls "cannot be used together with first frame / last
  // frame" — hence `mixedImageInputs: 'exclusive'`, the same contract the
  // Seedance 2.0 family carries. Reference AUDIO and VIDEO carry no such
  // restriction and ride along with either group.
  //
  // Pricing (kie, user-supplied 2026-08-26, matching kie.ai/pricing):
  //   Wan 3.0        480P  8/s   · 720P 16/s   · 1080P 32/s    (20% under official)
  //   Wan 3.0 Prime  480P 12.2/s · 720P 25.2/s · 1080P 50.4/s  (10% under official)
  // `official` is those same figures lifted back out of kie's own stated
  // discount (kie / 0.8 and kie / 0.9 respectively) rather than read off
  // Alibaba's page — kie publishes the gap, not the competitor's rate, and the
  // pair lands on clean numbers ($0.05/$0.10/$0.20 and $0.068/$0.14/$0.28) which
  // is what a real list price looks like. Re-verify if kie restates the
  // discount.
  //
  // THE ESTIMATE IS A FLOOR, for the same reason MiniMax H3's and Seedance
  // 2.5's are: kie bills (input video duration + output duration) x unit
  // price, so a reference clip is charged as if it were extra output. We can't
  // know a clip's length at estimate time, and quoting the output seconds
  // alone is the honest direction to be wrong in for a member who attaches
  // none. kie's +10% top-up bonus lowers the effective rate another ~10% and
  // is likewise not modelled — it also moves the real figure down.
