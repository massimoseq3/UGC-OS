        {/* The workspace pane. It was a macOS-style floating "window" — a
            rounded, bordered, translucent frame with the desktop gradient
            peeking around it — until August 2026, when the frame came off:
            it fills the space between the menu bar and the dock flush now, so
            every app gets the full width and nothing draws a box around them.
            Keep `overflow-hidden` (app chrome still clips to the pane) and the
            bottom inset (the dock floats over that strip; content underneath
            it would be unreachable). NO `backdrop-blur` here, deliberately:
            a `backdrop-filter` element is a backdrop root, and a repaint
            ANYWHERE inside it invalidates the whole backdrop. This pane
            contains the entire workspace, so every animating pixel in every
            app — a dozen generating tiles during a B-Roll batch especially —
            dragged a full-viewport filter recompute behind it. That surfaced
            as laggy generation animations, laggy zoom (a zoom re-rasters
            everything, the backdrop included), and images going blocky, since
            a browser under that much compositing pressure drops its raster
            scale. Glass belongs on small, static chrome over real content
            (B-Roll's pinned storyboard strips), not on a full-window
            container.

            Only the BOTTOM inset is phone-aware: when the dock rolls away on
            a scroll (useChromeAutoHide) the pane claims its 98px. The top
            stays at `top-9` in every state, deliberately. It used to go to
            `top-0` and take the menu bar's 36px too — but the menu bar doesn't
            move, it's opaque and it's `fixed`, so what the app actually gained
            was 36px UNDERNEATH it: every app's first row slid out of sight,
            which on a two-pane app is the Setup/Storyboard tabs and on Outliers
            is the platform tabs. Scrolling a list is not a reason to cover the
            navigation, and 36px was never worth it.

            Deliberately NOT transitioned — `bottom` is layout, so animating it
            relayouts the entire app on every frame, and a storyboard's worth of
            cards can't pay that for 300ms. The dock slides; the pane simply
            grows underneath it, which is invisible because content is laid out
            from the top.

            The inset is the DOCK'S OWN expression, not a flat number: the dock
            is `fixed bottom-0` with `pb-[max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom),
            0.5rem)]`, so its height is ~90px of nav plus whichever of those two
            wins. In a browser tab `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` is 0 — the
            browser's own bar owns that strip — so the 8px floor wins and this
            is 98px. INSTALLED to the home screen it
            isn't: `viewport-fit=cover` plus no browser bar means the page runs
            to the physical bottom edge and the inset reports the ~34px the home
            indicator sits in, so the dock stands 22px taller than a flat 108
            reserves and covered the bottom of every pinned Generate button.
            Both halves derive from the same numbers now, so they can't drift.
            Even with the dock rolled away the safe area is still held back —
            it's the strip the home indicator lives in, and content under it is
            content you can't reliably touch. */}

                    than it bought: below the floor the pane became a SECOND
