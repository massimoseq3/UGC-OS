          delivery settings, so they sit together on the approach to the button
          and leave it alone at the foot of the column — the same shape Scripts
          uses above its own Generate, and the reason the stepper takes `xl`:
          58px is the picker-row height, so the pair is one line by
          construction rather than by a copied number.

          The model row is unlabelled and uncarded on purpose — a picker row
          already shows the model's name over its hint, and a border around one
          control says nothing (see the root CLAUDE.md). The pick persists per
          browser under `voice-studio:tts`, the same key `resolveTtsModel()`
          reads at generate time, and it is what `modelId` prices against — so
          this row and the credits pill on the button can never name different
          models. */}
