/**
 * The shell both of this app's pickers wear — the voice list and the saved
 * presets.
 *
 * They were in-panel views that took over the left column, which worked while
 * that column held nothing but settings. It now holds Generate, and a picker
 * that covers the whole column covers the button too — so both come out to a
 * centred modal, the shape every other picker in the app already uses
 * (`PresetPickerModal`, `BankPicker`). Massimo asked for the presets to pop
 * like those; the voice list follows because the two are the same gesture one
 * after the other and are the one place in the app where two pickers sit a
 * click apart, so they can't wear different clothes.
 *
 * Geometry is `PresetPickerModal`'s, with one difference: these hold a LIST of
 * rows rather than a wall of pictures, so the panel is `max-w-xl` and sizes to
 * its content under a `max-h-[86vh]` ceiling. A fixed `h-[86vh]` would open a
 * near-empty box on a bank holding three presets. `fill` is `Modal`'s height
 * decision for the voice list: thirty rows always reach the ceiling, and a
 * search box over them that shrank the panel on every keystroke would re-centre
 * it and move the box you are typing in.
 *
 * The backdrop is `bg-black/50`, the dim `Modal`, `BankPicker` and the history
 * rails all put behind a picker.
 *
 * Tier is `z-[60]` for the reason spelled out in `PresetPickerModal`: every
 * `Dropdown` / `AnchoredPopover` menu portals at that tier over a `z-[55]`
 * catcher, so a panel above it paints over its own menus. Sharing the tier
 * lets DOM order decide, and a menu appended to the body later wins.
