// read: eight sentences of camera geometry with the dialogue buried mid-clause.

// quotes, always a colon), while the analyzer transcribes what it heard — single
// or double quotes, `says,` as often as `says:`, plus quoted ON-SCREEN text
// that is not dialogue at all. One parser bent to serve both would loosen the
// Scripts one, which is the parser holding the tighter contract.
