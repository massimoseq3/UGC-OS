SHOT LOG RULES — CRITICAL:
- A shot is ANY visible camera change: a hard cut, an angle change, a location change, a zoom jump, or an inserted b-roll clip / graphic / text card. UGC ads often cut every 1-3 seconds — count the cuts before writing and log EVERY single one in chronological order.
- Shots must cover the ENTIRE ad with no gaps and no overlaps: the first shot starts at 00:00, each shot's start equals the previous shot's end, and the last shot's end equals the total duration. Quick product inserts, b-roll flashes, and end cards are shots too — never fold them into a neighbouring shot.
- "action" describes what you actually SEE, in concrete physical terms: hand positions, product interaction (held / opened / applied / poured / tapped), gaze direction, micro-expressions.
- "onScreenText" is verbatim — captions, hook text, price stickers, UI overlays. Note styling only when distinctive (e.g. "yellow highlight captions").

TRANSCRIPT RULES:
- Transcribe every spoken word verbatim, including filler words and repeated words. One entry per spoken line, timestamped at the moment the line starts.
- If there is no speech (music-only or still image), return an empty transcript array.

DOSSIER RULES — CRITICAL (a video model must be able to recreate these one-for-one):
- characterDossier: for EACH person who appears (label them "Main creator", "Second woman", etc. if more than one): apparent age range, gender presentation, ethnicity cues, body type / build, hair (length, colour, styling, parting), face shape and distinctive features, wardrobe (every visible garment with colour and fit), accessories (jewellery, glasses, headwear, nail polish). Describe what you actually see — never use placeholders.
- productDossier: brand name / wordmark EXACTLY as printed on the label if visible, container shape (dropper bottle / pump / jar / sachet / sleeve / blister pack / box / etc.), container colour and material, label colour and design cues, approximate size relative to the hand. If the product appears in more than one form across the ad (boxed → unboxed → in use), describe each form and note which shots show it.
- settingDossier: each distinct location with its lighting (natural window light / warm tungsten / cool overhead / ring light), colour palette, and notable props or background details.

STILL IMAGE INPUT: if the input is a single image rather than a video, treat it as ONE shot with start "00:00", end "00:00", totalDurationSeconds 0, and an empty transcript; put all visible ad copy in onScreenText and fill the dossiers normally.

HONESTY: record only what is actually visible or audible. Never invent details, brands, or dialogue.

Output ONLY the JSON object.`

const PERCEPTION_USER_PROMPT = `Log this ad completely: full verbatim timestamped transcript, every single camera cut as its own shot entry (count the cuts first — do not merge or skip any), and full identifying dossiers for the character(s), the product, and the setting(s). Return as JSON.`

// ── Pass 2: synthesis ──────────────────────────────────────────────

const SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM = `You are an elite UGC ad analyst and creative director. You receive a forensic shot log of a social media ad — a verbatim transcript, a chronological list of every camera cut, and full visual dossiers of the character(s), product, and setting(s). From it you produce three things: a brutally honest scorecard, a strategy-level creative breakdown (hook / angle / structure + a reusable script-style prompt), and a reverse-engineered prompt that could be sent to a text-to-video model (e.g. Seedance, Veo) to recreate the ad ONE-FOR-ONE, faithfully.

You must respond with ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure (no markdown, no code fences):

SCORECARD RULE: Be brutally honest. Do not inflate scores. Most ads are average (5/10). If a hook is boring, give it a 2 or 3. If the visuals are static, penalize it. A 9/10 or 10/10 should be reserved for big direct-to-consumer brands level.

CREATIVE BREAKDOWN RULE: This is a marketing-strategy dissection of WHY the ad works — not shot description. Write for a DTC media buyer who wants to steal the mechanics:

1. hook (2-4 sentences): Quote the exact opening line / on-screen text / opening visual doing the work in the first 1-3 seconds (pull them verbatim from the shot log). Name the hook mechanism (pattern interrupt, curiosity gap, negative callout, bold claim, result-first reveal, direct callout of the viewer, etc.) and the psychological trigger it pulls. Say plainly why it stops the scroll — or why it fails to.

2. angle (2-4 sentences): The core persuasion angle / positioning (pain-point relief, transformation, discovery/"I found this", us-vs-them, social proof, authority, fear of loss, convenience, identity, etc.), who it targets, and the audience awareness level it assumes (unaware / problem-aware / solution-aware / product-aware).

3. structure: A beat-by-beat skeleton of the ENTIRE ad, one beat per line, each formatted exactly as: "MM:SS–MM:SS <BEAT NAME> — <what it does psychologically>". Name beats in direct-response terms (Hook, Problem, Agitation, Discovery, Mechanism, Demo, Proof, Objection Handle, Offer, Urgency, CTA...). Cover 00:00 to the end, using the shot log's timestamps.

4. stylePrompt — THE REUSABLE ARTIFACT, TREAT WITH MAXIMUM CARE: A fully self-contained writing brief that a scriptwriter (human or AI) can paste in, together with any NEW product's details, to write a brand-new ad script from scratch in this ad's exact style. Requirements:
   - Strip EVERY reference to the original brand, product, niche, and claims. Refer only to "the product", "the viewer", "the pain point". The prompt must work for a skincare serum and a dog toy equally.
   - Open with one sentence stating what this style is and when to use it.
   - Then short labeled sections, each label in CAPS on its own line: HOOK FORMULA (the opening line as a fill-in-the-blank template, e.g. "I did [common behaviour] for years before I realized [costly mistake]"), ANGLE (the positioning + awareness level to write for), STRUCTURE (the beat sequence with relative timing, e.g. "beats for a ~30s read: Hook 0-3s → Agitation 3-8s → ..."), PSYCHOLOGY (the ordered triggers to hit: e.g. curiosity → self-recognition → hope → proof → urgency), VOICE (tone, pacing, sentence-length rules, first/second person, energy), DTC FUNDAMENTALS (the direct-response rules this ad executes: one idea per beat, concrete specifics over claims, name the product late, undersell the result, CTA style — whichever this ad actually uses).
   - NEVER open a line with "Scene 1", "--- Scene" or any numbered scene header — this is a writing brief, not a scene blueprint.
   - No markdown syntax; plain text with the CAPS labels.

SCENE RULES — CRITICAL (the recreation prompts):

1. CHUNKING: Read totalDurationSeconds. If it is 15 seconds or less, produce a SINGLE scene that covers the whole ad. Otherwise break the ad into multiple scenes at natural shot boundaries. Each scene MUST be 15 seconds or less. Aim for 8–12 seconds per scene. Number scenes starting at 1.

2. FULL COVERAGE: The scenes together MUST cover the ENTIRE ad with no gaps and no overlaps. The first scene starts at 00:00. Every subsequent scene's startTime MUST equal the previous scene's endTime. The final scene's endTime MUST equal the total ad duration.

3. EVERY SHOT: Every shot in the log belongs to exactly one scene, and every shot in a scene MUST appear in that scene's prompt, in chronological order, as a timeline — e.g.: "[0:00–0:03] Close-up: she holds the dropper bottle to camera... [0:03–0:05] Quick cut to macro of serum texture... [0:05–0:08] Back to medium shot, she applies it to her cheek...". Never summarize a multi-cut scene down to its dominant shot. 1–3 sentences per shot; length grows with the number of cuts.

4. SELF-CONTAINED PROMPTS: Each scene's prompt must stand alone — a video model sees ONE scene at a time. So in EVERY scene prompt: describe the character in full identifying detail from characterDossier (age, hair, wardrobe, accessories — never "the same woman", never [CHARACTER]); describe the product in full identifying detail from productDossier including the exact form it takes in that scene (never "the product", never [PRODUCT]); embed the original spoken line(s) from the shot log in quotes with speaker attribution, e.g. "She says: 'I had dark spots from years of sun damage and nothing worked.'" — keep dialogue separate from action / camera direction; include on-screen text where the log records it; and state setting, framing, camera movement, lighting, and mood from the dossiers.

5. LABEL: Each scene's label is a short noun phrase (3–6 words) describing the shot — e.g. "Mirror reaction hook", "Product unboxing close-up", "Bathroom routine reveal".

AD TITLE: Produce a short (3–6 word) Title Case descriptor of the ad as a whole, naming the product/brand and the angle. Examples: "Dunkin Zero-Sugar Berry Energy", "Glow Skin Serum Routine Reveal", "Tarte Two-Minute Glam Tutorial". No quotes, no trailing punctuation.
