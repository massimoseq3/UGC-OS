/**
 * The centred preset browser — the starters shipped with the app and the

 *
 * It was a 380px right slide-over, which is the wrong shape for a picture
 * library: three faces across meant the starters alone ran past a screen, and
 * a member's own characters were only reachable by scrolling past every
 * built-in. A centred modal gets six across at a size a face is still
 * judgeable at and pages the grid in as you scroll rather than mounting a few
 * hundred image decodes on open.
 *
 * The two libraries are ONE scroll, in two labelled sections — your own
 * characters, then the templates (Massimo's call, August 2026). They were a
 * toggle that swapped the grid for a while, on the theory that a member with
 * 35 characters shouldn't scroll past all of them to reach a template; the
 * jump below is the cheaper answer to that, and it keeps everything the picker
 * holds in one list you can simply keep scrolling. The toggle stays, as a JUMP
 * with a count on each side: clicking scrolls to that section (pulling in
 * enough pages to reach it first), and the highlight follows the scroll rather
 * than the other way round.
 *
 * Calls `onPick` with the chosen recipe as a flat profile map, then closes.
 * Callers decide what to do with that map: apply it wholesale
 * (LoadPresetDropdown) or merge only a subset of keys (the scoped Physical /
 * Scene & Pose preset buttons in ControlsPanel).
 *
 * **Mount it only while it's open.** Every caller does, and the browsing state
 * — the page count and which section the rail is lit on — is per-opening
 * because of that, with no effect resetting anything. Left mounted behind
 * `open={false}` it keeps that state while its scroller does not (a new one
 * starts at the top), so the rail lit the section you left off in while the
 * grid showed the first, and the page count stayed wherever the last visit had
 * raised it — the hitch `PAGE` exists to avoid. The starter library is cached
 * in `presets/service.ts`, so reopening re-fetches nothing.

            The rail is the TABLE OF CONTENTS of that scroll, and nothing on it
            filters (Massimo's call, August 2026). Every row is a place in the
            list — your characters, then each style the templates are filed
            under — clicking one scrolls there, and the highlight FOLLOWS THE
            SCROLL, the way the Ad Analyzer's section toggle follows its read.
            One rule for the whole rail: it says where you are.

            Two shapes were tried on the way here and both were worse. The
            styles were a `Dropdown` on the filter bar — eleven options behind a
            click, on a panel whose whole job is browsing — and then a rail that
            filtered, which reads as a set of tabs: it hides the ten other looks
            the moment you glance at one, when the point of the grid is that you
            keep scrolling through it. Navigating costs nothing the filter
            saved, because the section a jump lands on is the same handful of
            cards the filter would have left.

            Search and gender stay real filters, on the bar above the grid,
            because they cut ACROSS the sections rather than picking one.

            Below `lg` there is no room for a rail beside a grid of faces, so
            the same two controls ride the bar: the library toggle, and the
            style menu — which is this rail's Style block, one option per
            section, jumping exactly as the rows do. */}
