// Save / delete / download + name-draft state for one history entry. Shared by
// the grid tile and the list row so both views stay in lockstep. Copy-prompt and
// make-sheet stay as parent callbacks (they reach into modal/clipboard concerns).
// `near` is how a LIST keeps its media cost proportional to the window rather
// than to the history. The gallery is uncapped, so a working member's grid is
// hundreds of tiles — and every one of them used to resolve its blob and hand
// the browser a full-size picture to decode on mount, with about nine on screen.
// `loading="lazy"` does not help: it defers a FETCH, and by the time the <img>
// exists the blob URL has already been made. Gating the resolution itself is
// what actually keeps the decode off, and the placeholder branch below is
// already sized by `aspectStyle` / the row's own `aspectRatio`, so a tile
// waiting its turn holds exactly the shape it will fill — the scroll height
// never changes and nothing jumps as pictures arrive.
//
// Defaults to true so the callers with ONE item (the Single stage) are
// unchanged; only the grid and list rows pass a scroller to observe against.
// Re-entering the viewport is instant rather than a second read: the component
// stays mounted while it waits, so useAssetUrlState still holds the resolved
// entry for this ref and hands it straight back.
//
// This gates the PICTURE only. `handleDownload` re-resolves through getUrl on
// its own, so every action on the tile works the same whether it has painted
// or not.
// `full` asks for the ORIGINAL file rather than the grid-sized thumbnail
// (utils/mediaThumbs). The grid tile and the list row show the thumbnail —
// it's what keeps a wall of 4K portraits from being re-decoded every time the
// column scrolls back over them — and the Single stage, where one picture is
