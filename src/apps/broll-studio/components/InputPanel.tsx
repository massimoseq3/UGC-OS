                unpicked session folds to UGC Realism rather than greying out
                Generate. The delivery toggle MOVED, to just below the card. The
                hairline that used to separate the two of them from the script
                went with them: with nothing but references left in here there is
                no second half to mark off. */}

              three the character speaking that line, staged three different
              ways. It sits BETWEEN the References card and the Instructions box
              (August 2026), not as the card's last row: the card is what the
              storyboard is built FROM, and this is a decision about what to
              build — it was the only switch in a list of things you attach, and
              it needed a hairline inside the card to say so, which is a rule
              admitting the row is in the wrong box. Shrink-0 — a fixed h-12 row
              in a column whose script box takes the leftover height. It keeps
              that 48px switch height rather than a picker row's 58px: it's a
              two-word toggle, not a row that opens something. (It has also led
              the settings band, sat at that band's bottom directly above
              Generate, sat at the very top of the column above the References
              heading, and sat inside the References card.)
              Continuous has no deliveries — it's narration over footage — so
              it isn't rendered there at all. **B-Roll Clips leads the toggle
              AND is the default** (September 2026, Massimo's call). Position
              and default were deliberately split for a month — the plainer
              thing first, the default on the one most members were here to
              make — and that reading is what changed, not the reasoning: an
              opening storyboard of silent b-roll is what most sessions want,
              and a member laying dialogue over it is picking a mode rather
              than correcting one. */}
