      {/* The strip is an OVERLAY pinned to the panel's top edge, and the
          storyboard scrolls UNDER it, blurred (September 2026, Massimo's call).
          Getting here took three shapes and the difference between them is the
          whole note.

          It was `sticky top-0` INSIDE the scroll port until August 2026, and it
          visibly came loose from the top edge on the way back up a long
          storyboard: a backdrop-filter element re-samples its backdrop on the
          main thread while the scroller itself is scrolled by the compositor,
          so the bar lagged its own container by a frame or two and snapped
          back. The fix then was to lift it OUT of the scroller as a plain
          static sibling — which cured the lag, and cost the picture: nothing
          passed under it any more. That is why the glass tried in between was
          reverted on sight. A wash over a panel that never moves has nothing to
          frost; it just lifts a 57px band a shade off the panel it belongs to
          and reads as a seam.

          Absolute is both halves at once. The bar is NOT in the scroller, so it
          cannot lag it by construction — it is laid out against this panel and
          nothing about a scroll moves it — and the scroller now runs the full
          height of the panel behind it, so cards really do pass underneath. The
          scroll port pays for it with `pt-[77px]` (the bar's 57px plus the 20px
          the content already stood off by), which is what keeps scene one clear
          of the bar at scroll-top. Those two numbers move together.

          The fill is `.app-backdrop-frost` (index.css), which is the PAGE
          GRADIENT at 72% and viewport-anchored, over a 40px blur — not a flat
          token. That distinction is the whole of two bug reports. It shipped as
          `bg-surface-0/72` and read DARKER than the columns either side of it,
          and the panel's left divider — a neutral hairline with the page
          gradient on one side and this band on the other — read as changing
          colour, "glowing" as saturated cards passed beneath. `index.css`
          already had the finding written down for the opaque case: a flat token
          cannot match a radial gradient that moves ~10 units across one bar's
          width, and at 72% it was still 72% of the wrong colour. Matched to the
          gradient the bar is pixel-identical to its surroundings at rest, so
          the divider reads the same above, inside and below the band, and the
          only thing that ever tints it is the storyboard actually showing
          through — which is the point. No `backdrop-saturate` for the same
          reason: saturating whatever card is underneath is what made that wash
          read as coloured. `z-20` so a card's own positioned hover chrome can't
          paint over it. */}
      {/* ONE line, at EVERY width: what the storyboard IS on the left, what you
          can do to it on the right (August 2026, Massimo's call).

          That was the old shape and it used to break — the buttons are
          `shrink-0` (a batch pill you can't read is a batch you won't press), so
          the meta took every squeeze, and past its own min-content the count and
          the style pill PAINTED OVER the first button; reported at 900px, where
          the port is ~590px against 592px of pills. It was answered first by
          wrapping (a strip two rows tall on some windows and one on others) and
          then by moving the meta out of the bar entirely, down into the
          storyboard. What makes it work now is that NOTHING on the line shrinks
          and the line itself scrolls: every pill is `shrink-0`, the meta
          included, so the collision it kept losing simply can't be expressed.

          `w-max min-w-full` is the whole trick. When the content fits, the row
          is exactly the port, so the `flex-1` spacer opens up and pushes the
          buttons to the right edge; when it doesn't, the row is exactly its
          content, the spacer collapses to nothing, and the meta and buttons sit
          shoulder to shoulder in one swipeable line that starts at the scene
          count. `-mx-5 px-5` so it scrolls edge to edge while its first and last
          pills still sit on the panel's own inset. */}
      {/* `h-[57px]`, the app-wide panel-header height, NOT vertical padding
          around the pills: the History rail's own band next door is 57px, so
          `py-3.5` made this strip 61px and the two hairlines missed each other
          by 4px across the seam (Massimo's report, September 2026). A stated
          height is also what keeps them level if a pill on either side ever
          changes size. The scroll port under it takes `flex-1 min-w-0` rather
          than a width — see the note below, which the flex parent doesn't
          change: with both margins negative the row still resolves to exactly
          the strip's padding box. */}

            strip's CONTENT box, so the port came out 40px narrower than the
            strip and the negative margin then spent all of it on the left —
            the row started at the panel's inset and ended 40px shy of it. With
            the width left `auto` the block fills its container and the two
            negative margins widen it by exactly the padding they cancel, so the
            port spans the strip and `px-5` puts both ends back on the panel's
            own inset. Invisible while the row was centred (it just shifted the
            centre 20px left); it shows the moment anything is right-aligned. */}

              at the head of a row of buttons reads as a fragment of one rather

              images, the animate pass, videos — tinted as one family in three
              depths so the row read as a sequence getting more expensive. What
              that cost is the whole bar: three long labels are ~450px, which is
              most of the panel at every width the right pane actually gets, and
              it is why the labels had to shorten below `lg` and why the row had
              to scroll on a phone at all. The passes are also mutually
              exclusive in practice — you run one, wait for it, then run the
              next — so they are a choice, not four things to reach for.

              The menu is the same anchored popover the constraint chips use, so
              it escapes the strip's own clip and can't be cut off by the scroll
              port it sits in. */}

          desktop — number, hairline rule, the line running away to the right,
          the buttons parked on the far edge — a shape a phone had already given

          the storyboard's own centred batch strip instead of reading as a
          second bar aligned a different way. The rule went with the split (it
          divided a row that no longer exists) and so did the `LINE N` chip: it
          printed the scene's number two inches under the 48px numeral that is

          carries four — an added option, or a session generated back when
          Dialogue Clips emitted a fourth card — runs five wide rather than
          wrapping the Add card onto a line of its own.

          The column count is a CONTAINER query, never a viewport one: what
          squeezes this grid is the OUTPUT COLUMN, which loses ~340px the moment
          the History rail opens. On `xl:` the four cells stayed four on a 2000px
          screen with the rail out, dropping every card to ~170px — so the tiles
          a member is actually judging got small to keep an empty Add card on
          their line. Below the four-up threshold the row narrows to three and
          the Add card wraps onto a line of its own, which is the cell we can
          afford to lose.

          The Add card is a FULL cell, not a half one. It was halved for a day
