// How long a clip has to be to hold ONE SPOKEN line of the script.
//
// A card whose character SPEAKS its line to camera is as long as the words take
// to say. It used to be a flat 5s, which is the wrong answer in both
// directions: a twenty-word line crammed into 5s comes back with the character
// gabbling, and a five-word hook stretched over the same 5s comes back slow and
// dead. Both were reported, which is what this module exists for.
//
// **Auto is a WITH DIALOGUE thing, and only that.** It shipped applying to
// every card in both deliveries and was pulled back to the dialogue cards in
// August 2026. A silent Voiceover Clips card has no words in it — it's cutaway
// footage that a voiceover is laid over in the edit — so nothing about its
// length follows from the line it was written for, and deriving one from a
// word count is a number invented for a clip that isn't saying them. Those
// cards keep the flat default they always had (`speaksItsLine` is the one test,
// and it's the same `tag === 'DIALOGUE'` predicate the voice profile and the
// anchor chain already go by).
//
// Deliberately a word-count estimate rather than a number the storyboard model
// answers with. It's free, deterministic and debuggable, it costs no prompt
// surface and no parser, and it's the same ~2.4 words/sec pace Scripts already
// writes its word budgets against — so a script written for a beat and the clip
// rendered for that beat agree by construction. Continuous mode has estimated
// its scene lengths this way since it shipped; this is that estimator, shared.

// Half a second, not the full one it shipped with (August 2026). The estimate

// top of it, and then a snap UP onto the model's ladder. Two of the three are
// gone — this is now a half-beat, the ceil only survives where there's no ladder

// reasoning that rounding down truncates the line — but a duration ladder is
// coarse (…5, 6, 8, 10, 12…), so an estimate that overshoots a rung by a third
// of a second bought a whole extra rung, and the result was reported as running
// 1–2s long on card after card. It isn't a truncation to protect against
// anyway: the video model FITS the speech to the clip it's given, so a rung
// short reads as a slightly brisker delivery (the UGC register) while a rung
// long is dead air at the end of every cut. Ties go up, and the snap caps at
// the model's longest option, so a model with a short ladder gives what it can
// rather than a duration kie would reject.
//
// With no ladder at all there's nothing to snap to, so the raw estimate is
// ceiled — a length is whole seconds by the time anything bills it.
