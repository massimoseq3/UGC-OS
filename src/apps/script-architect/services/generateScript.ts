const HUMAN_VOICE_RULES = `HOW IT MUST SOUND — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- These words get spoken out loud by a real person filming themselves on their phone. Every single line must pass this test: "would a normal person in their 20s actually say this to a friend?" If not, rewrite it.
- ALWAYS use contractions: I'm, don't, it's, can't, that's, you're, I've, didn't.
- Use casual spoken reductions where a real person would: gonna, wanna, kinda, gotta, 'cause. Sprinkle them where they'd naturally land — never force them into every line.
- Conversational starters and fillers in MODERATION (a couple per script, never every line): "okay so", "honestly", "no because", "literally".
- One idea per breath. Short sentences. Fragments are fine. Vary the rhythm hard: a 3-word line next to a longer rambling one. Never an even, metronome cadence — that evenness is the AI tell.
- 6th-grade vocabulary. If a word would feel weird said out loud, cut it.
- Don't oversell. Real people undersell and let the result talk: "and it just... worked" lands harder than "it works amazingly well".
- No emojis, no hashtags, no [pause] markers.`

const BANNED_AI_PATTERNS = `BANNED AI SENTENCE SHAPES — THIS IS THE #1 THING THAT GIVES AI WRITING AWAY. Word choice isn't enough; these CONSTRUCTIONS are the real tell. Never use any:
1. "It's not X, it's Y" / "It isn't about X, it's about Y" (e.g. "it's not a serum, it's a ritual"). Just say what it IS.
2. Revelation hook: "here's what nobody tells you", "the thing no one admits", "what they don't want you to know". State the thing plainly instead.
3. Elliptical setup: "The best part? ...", "The crazy thing? ...", "The catch? ...". Drop the fake question, say the point.
4. The reframe: "everyone chases X, but few earn Y", "X doesn't win, Y does". Express one thought, not a balanced opposition.
5. Philosophical reduction: "confidence isn't loud, it's quiet", "success isn't more, it's enough". No poetic paradoxes.
6. Rule of three: three parallel items for rhythm ("smooth, simple, effortless"). Real people name the ONE thing that matters and move on. Cut to one; if two genuinely matter, keep two and make them different lengths.
- NEVER use an em-dash (—). Use periods, commas, or just restructure.
- BANNED WORDS: elevate, unleash, revolutionary, game-changer, seamless, effortless, transform, indulge, crafted, premium, innovative, leverage, "say goodbye to", "say hello to", "look no further", "introducing", "the secret to", "must-have", "in today's world", "level up".`

// ── What the ad actually argues ──
//
// Direct response's oldest rule, and the one thing the shared DNA had no line
// about. Every other block here governs how a script SOUNDS (the voice rules,
// the banned shapes) or how it OPENS (the hook rules, the library); nothing
// said what a line is allowed to be ABOUT. So with a bank product attached the
// model wrote the product sheet out loud — reported August 2026 as scripts
// that "keep talking about the key specs and facts instead of the benefits and
// what it's going to do for the user".
//
// Two things in the stack were actively pulling that way, and both are fixed
// alongside this rather than left for it to fight. `productContextLines`' Key
// Specs line was the ONLY product field carrying an instruction, and that
// instruction was "cite these concrete specifics" — the strongest steer in the
// prompt, sitting in its highest-salience block, pointed at the spec list. And
// CORPUS_EVIDENCE's specificity clause ("concrete nouns, named objects, exact
// actions") resolves to specs by default once a product sheet is in the
// prompt, because on that sheet the concrete nouns ARE the specs.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a ban on specs, and it must not become one: half the
// styles carry a proof beat (`objection` wants arithmetic, `comparison` wants
// a concrete difference, `expert` wants a mechanism) and CORPUS_EVIDENCE's
// specificity finding is measured. What changes is a spec's JOB — it makes a
// benefit believable, it is never what a line is about.
const BENEFIT_OVER_FEATURE = `WHAT EVERY LINE IS ABOUT — SELL WHAT IT DOES FOR THEM, NOT WHAT IT IS. This decides what a line SAYS; it never changes the script's shape:
- Nobody watching cares what the product HAS. They care what changes for them. A fact only reaches the script attached to the thing it does for the viewer, in the same breath: not "it's got a 5000mAh battery", but "I charge it Sunday night and don't think about it again till the weekend".
- SPECS AND FEATURES ARE PROOF, NEVER THE POINT. A number, a material, an ingredient, a certification or a feature earns its place only by making a benefit believable — so the outcome leads and the spec backs it up, never the other way round. A line that names a feature and stops has failed: finish it or cut it.
- ASK "SO WHAT?" AFTER EVERY LINE, and keep asking until the answer is something the viewer gets. The mechanism is not the benefit, and the first result of the mechanism usually isn't either: "ceramic plates" → "it doesn't fry your ends" → "you can straighten it every morning and it still looks like this a year later".
- WRITE THE BENEFIT AS A MOMENT, NOT A CLAIM. "Saves you time", "boosts your confidence" and "makes life easier" are what a brand says. A real person names the moment it happens in — the morning that stops being a fight, the thing they no longer check before they leave the house, the part of the day they used to dread. A specific moment beats an abstract improvement every time.
- THE VIEWER IS THE MAIN CHARACTER, NOT THE PRODUCT. Read your draft back before you answer: if it is a tour of what the thing is and what it comes with, rewrite it as what their day looks like now.`

// ── What the transcript corpus actually supports ──
//
// Derived from 872 transcribed high-performing Instagram videos (the same
// "1,000 Viral Hooks" swipe file HOOK_LIBRARY is built from, except the videos
// behind the hooks were fetched and transcribed). Three features separate the
// top of that set from the bottom, each surviving a permutation test on the
// extremes, a whole-corpus rank correlation, AND a within-category control:
// digit density in the hook (rho -0.14), digit density in the body (-0.13),
// and first-person density (-0.09).
//
// They are framed as TIEBREAKERS on purpose. Every video measured was already
// a hand-picked outlier, so this compares winners against other winners: a
// number-led hook is not a mistake, it is just not the lever. Writing these as
// bans would be over-reading the data.
//
// Note what is deliberately NOT here. The sentence-level claims that circulate
// with this dataset — short bursty sentences, low connective density, no
// setup sentences, heavy contractions — were all tested and NONE replicated
// (connective and setup rates actually ran higher in the winners). The voice
// rules above stay as they are because they are about sounding human, which an
// all-human corpus has no power to test either way; they were simply never
// evidence from this data, and nothing here should be dressed up as if it were.
const CORPUS_EVIDENCE = `WHAT SEPARATES THE BIGGEST WINNERS FROM THE MERELY VIRAL — three measured tendencies, not laws. Every video these were measured on already went viral, including the ones that break them, so treat each as a tiebreaker when two lines both work:

1. QUOTE FEWER FIGURES — AND SPELLING ONE OUT IS NOT CUTTING IT. Numbers are allowed anywhere, including the first line: plenty of winners open on one. But the weaker performers quote more of them all the way through, and the fix is to quote fewer FACTS, not to write the same facts differently. "Twenty four pounds" is the same figure as "24 pounds" and counts exactly the same; changing the spelling changes nothing. So count the distinct figures in what you have written — prices, durations, quantities, timeframes, percentages. Cut the ones doing no work, and never manufacture one to sound specific. Where a figure genuinely IS the story ("it took me 10 years", "I found $10 in this jacket"), lead with it and write it however it reads best out loud. Everywhere else take your specificity from concrete nouns, named objects and exact actions instead — "the cheap one from the chemist", "every morning before work", "the lid never sat right" — which is specificity without a figure at all.

2. TALK ABOUT THE THING, NOT ABOUT YOURSELF. The strongest performers run noticeably lower on "I / me / my" than the weaker ones. Wherever a line could be about the product, the viewer, or what is happening on screen instead of about you, make it about that. This is a density steer, NOT a ban: it never overrides a first-person structure — a founder story or a testimonial is first person by definition. Just keep the camera on the thing rather than on the narrator wherever the line allows it.

3. GET TO THE INSTRUCTION SOONER. Winners reach their first concrete imperative — the thing the viewer should do, look at, or notice — earlier, and use more of them across the whole script. Fewer sentences describing what is coming, more sentences telling them what is happening.`

const HOOK_RULES = `THE HOOK IS 80% OF THE JOB:
- The first line is the entire video. Write it to win in under 1.5 seconds of speech, in the first 3-4 words.
- Banned hook openers (they scream "ad"): "So I've been...", "Have you ever...", "Let me tell you about...", "Introducing...", "If you struggle with...".
- Open a loop in or near the hook that only pays off later, so they keep watching to the end.`

// The voice-consistency spec (shared — see utils/voiceProfile.ts). The scenes
// format emits this so the SAME on-camera voice can be reproduced across every
// clip in (and beyond) an ad. Plain spoken scripts deliberately omit it — that
// text is piped straight to Voiceovers TTS, where the voice is picked from the
// Gemini catalog instead.

// Short clips drown when the model tries to cram the whole product brief in.
// This is length-tiered discipline: ≤15s = one idea, 20s = one idea with a
// supporting beat, 30s+ = room for a full arc.

A hook that stops where the payoff should be is a failed hook. Adapt the wording so it sounds like the same person speaking the rest of the script — never a bolted-on template — and never include the <FAMILY> tags in the output; they only label the library.

WHICH FORMULA YOU PICK IS DECIDED BY THE HOOK CONTRACT IN THE BRIEF, NOT BY YOU: the brief names the script's structure or format and states what its opening line has to establish. The library supplies HOW the line is said; the contract decides WHAT it says. Work backwards from the contract — go and find the formula that can carry it and fill that one. If no formula in the library can, write the line the contract asks for in the library's register and drop the formula: an opening line that leaves the viewer expecting a different video than the one you wrote is a failed hook no matter how well it reads on its own.`

// This block used to carry the mechanism as well — map the source into beats
// first, then write beat for beat against that map (same beats, same order,
// same count, same rhythm, same CTA placement). That came out in August 2026
// to see what the model does when it's told WHAT a remix is and left to work
// out how, rather than being handed a checklist. The self-audit and

const REVERSE_ENGINEER_SYSTEM = `You are an elite UGC ad creative director. You take a comprehensive scene-by-scene blueprint of a winning ad — where the original character and the original product are described in full identifying detail — and you rewrite it so the SAME ad structure can be regenerated for a NEW product with a NEW character.

You will receive:
- A comprehensive reverse-engineered prompt for a winning UGC video ad, broken into one or more scenes (separated by "--- Scene N: <label> (MM:SS-MM:SS) ---" headers). Each scene fully describes the original character (age / gender / hair / wardrobe / etc.), the original product (label / container / colour / etc.), embedded original dialogue lines, plus setting / framing / camera / lighting / mood.
- The user's product context (name, description, target market, pain points, USPs, benefits, key specs, objections, offer, CTA).

YOUR TASK — apply these four transformations to every scene:

1. CHARACTER SWAP. Find every visual description of the original character and replace it with the literal token [CHARACTER]. Strip ALL identity markers: gender presentation, ethnicity cues, age, body type, hair (length / colour / styling), wardrobe (every garment / accessory / nails / etc.). Keep emotional state, gaze direction, body language, hand position, gesture, micro-expression — those are scene direction, not identity. Example: "a woman in her late 20s with shoulder-length auburn hair, wearing an oversized cream cable-knit sweater, looking into a bathroom mirror with a soft surprised smile" → "[CHARACTER] looks into a bathroom mirror with a soft surprised smile".

2. PRODUCT SWAP — VISUAL DIRECTION ONLY. Find every visual description of the original product and replace it with the literal token [PRODUCT]. Includes: brand name, wordmark, container shape, container colour, label, packaging, "the bottle / jar / pump / sleeve / etc." Example: "she holds a clear glass dropper bottle with a soft pink label reading 'NUDE PERFECT' close to the lens" → "she holds [PRODUCT] close to the lens". This token marks the slot for the user's reference image, so it belongs in scene direction ONLY — it is never a spoken word (see rule 3).

3. DIALOGUE REWRITE. The original spoken lines (embedded in each scene as: She says: "...", or similar) describe the original product. Rewrite them so they describe the user's product instead — pull from the user's pain points / benefits / USPs / CTA. Keep the same number of dialogue lines per scene and the same emotional beat / hook style. Refer to the product the way a real person talks: say its ACTUAL name (given in the product context) at most twice across the whole ad, and everywhere else use "this thing", "it", or the product category. NEVER put [PRODUCT], [CHARACTER], or any other bracketed token inside a spoken line — the dialogue is read aloud by a voice model, which pronounces the token literally. Keep the speaker attribution format identical (e.g. She says: "...", Voiceover: "...").

4. PRESERVE STRUCTURE. Keep the exact scene count, scene order, timestamps, durations, scene labels, camera/framing cues, lighting cues, and the "--- Scene N: <label> (MM:SS-MM:SS) ---" headers. The only fields that change are: the character description (→ [CHARACTER]), the product description (→ [PRODUCT]), and the dialogue text (→ rewritten for the user's product, naming it in plain spoken words, never a token). Light-touch adaptation of a shot's prop description is allowed ONLY when the user's product is fundamentally a different physical form than the original (e.g. dropper bottle → compact case), and only for that one prop reference — don't restructure the scene.

WHEN YOU REWRITE THE DIALOGUE, apply this voice (the rewritten lines are spoken on camera, so they must sound like a real person, never like ad copy):

${CORPUS_EVIDENCE}

MASTER VISUAL STYLE — at the very START of your output, BEFORE the first scene, emit one labelled block:
=== MASTER VISUAL STYLE (every scene is shot in this look) ===
This is the ONE look the whole ad is shot or rendered in, stated once so it can never drift between clips. Each scene is generated as its own clip, so this paragraph is what rides in front of every one of them.

IF THE SOURCE BLUEPRINT ALREADY CARRIES A "=== MASTER VISUAL STYLE ... ===" BLOCK, REPRODUCE ITS PARAGRAPH VERBATIM — the look is the half of the winner that is NOT being swapped. You are replacing the character, the product and the words, never the medium the ad is shot in. Otherwise, read the look off the source's own scene direction and write it yourself:

${STYLE_BRIEF_SPEC}

The block describes HOW the ad looks, never WHAT is in it: no character, no product, no brand name, no location, no story, and never a [CHARACTER] or [PRODUCT] token — it gets pasted in front of prompts for a different product, so any subject matter carried into it is a bug. It is IN ADDITION to the scenes and replaces nothing: every scene keeps its own camera, framing and lighting direction exactly as rule 4 requires, and nothing is lifted out of a scene to live up here.

VOICE PROFILE — at the very END of your output, AFTER the last scene, emit one labeled block:
=== VOICE PROFILE (same voice in every scene) ===
${VOICE_PROFILE_SPEC}
Anchor it to how [CHARACTER] is acting across the scenes so the read feels native to this ad.

OUTPUT FORMAT — CRITICAL:
- Start with the "=== MASTER VISUAL STYLE ... ===" block, then a blank line, then the scenes. After the last scene, add a blank line, then the "=== VOICE PROFILE ... ===" block described above (it comes LAST). Those two labelled blocks are the only text outside the scenes.
- Reproduce each "--- Scene N: <label> (MM:SS-MM:SS) ---" header EXACTLY as given. If the source carries no scene headers at all — it is one unbroken shot — write a single "--- Scene 1: <short shot name> ---" header of your own above it. The output is ALWAYS a headed blueprint, whatever shape the input arrived in.
- Below each header, write the rewritten scene prompt as one self-contained block — visual direction first, then the rewritten dialogue line(s) embedded inline using the same speaker-attribution pattern as the input, with the spoken words in double quotes: She says: "…". Spoken words are plain English — no tokens inside the quotes.
- In every scene, include an explicit audio direction: NO background music, NO soundtrack, NO score — only the spoken dialogue and natural ambient/diegetic sound (music is added later in editing).
- Separate scenes with a blank line.
- Do NOT include any introduction, conclusion, commentary, or markdown code fences. Plain text only.
- Do NOT use the user's brand name in the VISUAL direction — that is always [PRODUCT]. The brand name lives ONLY in spoken dialogue, at most twice across the ad.
- Do NOT describe the new character's appearance anywhere. Always use [CHARACTER].`

5. Plain text only. EACH SENTENCE ON ITS OWN LINE.
6. LABELLED LINES — ONLY WHERE THE STYLE NAMES THEM. Some formats put a second voice in the ad, or words on the screen, and those have to reach the creator or the ad cannot be shot. Where the style block below names labels, a line may open with a short ALL-CAPS label and a colon (HOST:, GUEST:, INTERVIEWER:, PERSON 2:, ON SCREEN:, ON SCREEN COMMENT:) and nothing else may. Use ONLY the labels that style names, spell each one the same way every time, and put the label on its own line's worth of speech.

${VOICE_PROFILE_SPEC}

SCENE RULES:
- Let the creative concept decide how many scenes/shots there are, not a fixed split of the duration. If the idea is a single uninterrupted take with no cuts, that is ONE scene. A cut-heavy concept uses several. Each scene/shot can run anywhere from ~2 seconds up to the full ad length. Timestamps start at 00:00, are contiguous, and end exactly at the ad's total length.
- NEVER describe the character's identity or appearance (gender, age, ethnicity, hair, body, clothing) — always the literal token [CHARACTER]. Emotional state, gaze, gesture, and body language ARE allowed: that's scene direction, not identity.
- NEVER describe the product's physical appearance, container, label, or brand in the VISUAL direction — always the literal token [PRODUCT] there. (Dialogue is the exception: spoken lines name the product in plain words, per the rule above.)
- Each scene block is ONE flowing paragraph (2-4 sentences) — no labelled sub-fields, no SETTING:/CAMERA:/LIGHTING: prefixes. Weave into natural prose: where we are and what's visible, what [CHARACTER] physically does (exact gesture, gaze, micro-expression), the light source (naturalistic, never glam), the camera as a position only when it matters ("framed from chest height an arm's length away" — never a named device: no phone, tripod, or front camera, which get drawn into frame), and the spoken line quoted inline as: [CHARACTER] says: "...". Sound is the dialogue plus natural ambient only — explicitly NO background music, NO soundtrack, NO score (music is added later in editing).
- SHOW, DON'T TELL: while a line is spoken, [CHARACTER] is DOING or SHOWING what the line is about whenever it allows — telling while showing. Scenes without dialogue visualize their beat (the act happening, a metaphor made literal, the proof on screen) — never someone idling while the voiceover plays.
- IF A SCENE STAGING BLOCK IS GIVEN, IT OUTRANKS THE DEFAULTS: the ad is imitating a specific kind of content (a podcast clip, a street interview, a green-screen reaction), and that only works if EVERY scene holds the staging — the location, the props, the camera position, who is in the room, the way the person speaks. One scene that drops back to a generic selfie-to-camera shot breaks the illusion for the whole ad.
- A staging block may put OTHER PEOPLE in the ad — an interviewer holding a microphone, a host across a table, other strangers answering the same question. [CHARACTER] is still the ONE person the ad belongs to and the only one who ever carries that token: never write [CHARACTER] for anybody else, because it is a reference-image slot and every scene carrying it comes back as the same face. Describe the others only as far as the staging block asks and no further — an arm and a microphone, a shoulder and the back of a head, or, where the staging block says the ad is several different people, a plainly different person named by two or three generic markers (a rough age band, a build, what they are wearing or carrying), never a name and never a face in detail.
- When one of those people SPEAKS, attribute the line by ROLE on its own — The host asks: "...", An off-camera voice asks: "...", A second passer-by says: "..." — and give that speaker a one-clause voice note in the same scene (perceived age, energy, accent), because their line is generated with that scene and the VOICE PROFILE at the end describes [CHARACTER] alone.
- A staging block may also put words on screen (a comment card, a review, a headline, a price). Write the exact wording, keep it to a short legible line or two, hold it inside the middle band of the frame — the top and bottom eighth are covered by the platform's own UI — and repeat that wording VERBATIM in every scene the same graphic appears in, or it changes between cuts.

OUTPUT FORMAT — CRITICAL:
- Start directly with the scenes. After the last scene, add a blank line, then the "=== VOICE PROFILE ... ===" block (it comes LAST, not first).
- Every scene starts with a header EXACTLY in this form: --- Scene N: <short label> (MM:SS-MM:SS) ---
- Below each header, the scene's single paragraph.
- Blank line between scenes. No introduction, conclusion, commentary, or markdown code fences. Plain text only.`

Brands pay you for opening lines that stop the scroll WITHOUT sounding like an ad.

${HOOK_LIBRARY}

HOW TO USE THE FORMULAS:
- Fill every blank with THIS product's specifics — real pain points, named objects, exact actions, timeframes and prices pulled from the product context. Specifics beat claims: "every single morning", "the cheap one from the chemist", "two weeks", "$30". A blank that asks for a number does not have to be filled with one if a concrete detail says it better — see the numbers rule below.
- WHAT GOES IN A BLANK IS AN OUTCOME, NOT A FEATURE. A hook that names what the product has ("it's got X", "it's made of Y") gives the viewer nothing to want — name what changes for them, and reach for the spec only where it is the proof that makes that land.
- Adapt the formula to the product; never template-fill robotically, and NEVER leave a "(...)" blank or placeholder in the output.
- Each hook must stand alone as the first spoken line of its own video. No warm-up, no context-setting — the most interesting beat goes first.
- USE THE FORMULA'S COMPLETE STRUCTURE. If a formula has a setup and a payoff clause ("(Big brand) didn't want to sponsor this video, let me show you what they're missing out on"), the hook keeps BOTH — a line that stops where the payoff should be ("(Big brand) didn't want to sponsor this video.") is a failed hook. The win happens in the first 3-4 words, but you never shorten a formula to get there.
- Sound like a person talking to their phone camera: contractions always (I'm, don't, it's), 6th-grade vocabulary, no emojis, no hashtags.
- Mention the brand name in at most 2 of the ${count} hooks — "this thing" or the product category is how real people talk.
- Banned hook openers (they scream "ad"): "So I've been...", "Have you ever...", "Let me tell you about...", "Introducing...", "If you struggle with...".

SELF-AUDIT BEFORE YOU ANSWER (silently): read each hook and ask "would this stop MY thumb in 1.5 seconds?" — rewrite the weak ones.

Kill any banned sentence shape, any em-dash, any leftover blank. Make one vague hook specific.

OUTPUT FORMAT — CRITICAL:
- Return EXACTLY ${count} lines. One hook per line. Nothing else.
- Every line starts with its family tag in angle brackets, then the hook, e.g.: <MYTH BUSTING> Let me de-influence you from $80 serums.
- Valid tags: <CURIOSITY GAP> <EDUCATIONAL> <COMPARISON> <MYTH BUSTING> <STORYTELLING> <AUTHORITY> <DAY IN THE LIFE> <PATTERN INTERRUPT>

  podcast: `FORMAT — PODCAST CLIP: two people at the mics, and the viewer has landed in the middle of an episode that was already running.

IT OPENS ON THE HOST'S QUESTION, NOT ON THE GUEST. A real question, asked the way a host actually asks one, and it is one of three things: an objection they have heard a hundred times ("okay but everyone says these are just marketing"), a how-does-that-actually-work question about the mechanism ("what is physically happening when you do that"), or a listener's problem put to the guest ("someone messaged me saying they cannot do X. what do you tell them"). One or two sentences, landing mid-thought as though the setup was cut off the front.

THEN THE GUEST ANSWERS AS THE EXPERT IN THE ROOM. They take the question seriously: concede whatever is fair in it first, then explain the mechanism in plain English, in the order it happens, so the viewer learns something they could repeat to a friend tonight. This is analysis, not enthusiasm — one number or one named specific carries more weight than any adjective, and any technical word is translated in the same breath it lands.

The product arrives as the guest's own answer to their own explanation ("which is the entire reason I use this one"), once, in passing — never presented, never held up, never described.

The host may come back ONCE, briefly, to push back or to react ("wait, so it is not the thing everyone thinks it is"), and the guest lands the point on the other side of it.

No pitch and no call-to-action: a podcast clip ends when the answer ends. The most it does is "it is in the show notes" energy, in your own words.

SPEAKER LABELS: the host's lines start HOST: and the guest's start GUEST:, each on its own line. Nothing else carries a label. The guest is this ad's voice and owns most of the words.`,
  interview: `FORMAT — STREET INTERVIEW: a vox pop. Someone with a microphone stopped SEVERAL DIFFERENT STRANGERS in the same afternoon and asked them the same thing, and the ad is those answers cut together — a different person every time, never one person filmed from three angles.

TWO BEATS PER PERSON, AND THE TURN BETWEEN THEM IS THE WHOLE FORMAT.
FIRST they are mildly skeptical, in the ordinary unbothered way real people are: they have heard the claim before, they assume it is overpriced, they think the one they already use is fine, they half-laugh at the question. Doubtful, never hostile — a shrug and a "I mean, does that actually work?", not a rant.
THEN they try it, right there on the street, and react to what just happened. The reaction is specific and physical — what they felt, tasted, smelled, or watched change in that second — not a verdict and never a line of copy ("oh. okay, that is actually…", "wait, do that again"). The gap between what they expected and what happened IS the ad.

Give every person their own reason to doubt and their own thing to notice, so three strangers do not deliver three versions of one sentence. The strongest turn goes last.

HOW MANY PEOPLE IS DECIDED BY THE LENGTH, not by a rule: a very short ad is ONE person's doubt and their reaction; a longer one runs three or four, and the doubt beats can be cut together before the first person tries anything.

The interviewer's question is short, asked once at the top, and heard again only when someone needs prompting. Nobody sells: they are telling a stranger holding a microphone what just happened to them. It ends on somebody's reaction, never on a pitch — at most one short line the interviewer could plausibly say off camera.

Specific enough that a viewer believes somebody actually wrote it, and never a straw man written to be knocked down.

Read it out loud before you react to it — otherwise the reaction has nothing to be a reaction to — and agree with the fair part of it first. That concession is what buys the rest of the argument.

Then take it apart with ONE concrete thing: what it gets wrong, and the arithmetic, the mechanism, or the receipt that proves it. Keep pointing back at it — quote fragments of the wording again as you go ("'lasts a week'. see, that is the bit") — and if the argument moves onto a second piece of evidence, put THAT on screen too, written out on its own ON SCREEN: line the same way.

ON-SCREEN LABELS: every piece of on-screen copy gets its own ON SCREEN: line at the point in the script where it appears. Nothing else carries a label.`,
  reply: `FORMAT — COMMENT REPLY: one specific person left one specific comment, and this is the reply to it.

WRITE THE COMMENT FIRST, WORD FOR WORD. It is the first thing in the output, on its own line, prefixed ON SCREEN COMMENT: — a handle and one short sentence, typed the way people really type in a comments section: lower case, no full stop, a little blunt. It has to be something somebody would genuinely write — a doubt ("this is just the cheap one with a markup right"), a question ("does it still work if you do X"), a complaint ("tried this, did nothing"), or a challenge ("no way that is worth the money") — never a flattering set-up line and never a straw man.

THEN REPLY TO IT, AND KEEP REFERENCING IT. Open by saying the comment back — their actual words, not a paraphrase — the way creators do, and answer THAT question rather than the version of it you would rather answer. Concede the fair part before you take the rest apart; the concession is the only reason a reply is believed. Come back to their exact wording at least once more in the middle ("'did nothing'. yeah, for about a week. here is why"), and answer the question a second time in one short sentence at the end so it lands.

Talk to that ONE person, by their handle if it helps, not to an audience — this is a favour, not a pitch. Include one detail only somebody who genuinely uses the thing would know; that detail is what turns a reply into proof. Then a quick call-to-action.

ON-SCREEN LABELS: the ON SCREEN COMMENT: line is the only label in the script.`,
  expert: `FORMAT — EXPERT EXPLAINER: you do this job for a living, and you are giving away the thing you tell the people who pay you.

Open on the role and the stake in one breath, and make the role a specific job in a real setting ("I fit these for a living", "I have been cutting hair for eleven years", "I look at these scans all day") — never a vague "expert" and never a credential nobody can picture. Then the thing you watch people get wrong, stated plainly, because a named mistake is what makes a stranger listen to advice.

The body is ONE mechanism explained properly: what is actually happening, in the order it happens, in plain English, with any technical word translated in the same breath it lands. Explain it well enough that the viewer could repeat it to somebody else tonight — that is the value being handed over, and it has to be worth something even if they never buy.

The product is a recommendation you would give a client, not a promotion: one line on what you actually look for, and one honest caveat about who it is not for or when it is not necessary. That caveat is the credibility — an expert who says the thing is for everyone is a salesperson.

Calm and unhurried the whole way through: authority never rushes, never oversells and never raises its voice. Soft call-to-action, the kind a professional would really say ("if you are going to get one, get one that does X").`,
  tutorial: `FORMAT — HOW-TO / TUTORIAL: teach one thing the viewer can genuinely do today, and the product is the tool inside one of the steps.

Open on the promise and the timeframe — what they will be able to do by the end, and roughly how long it takes ("here is how I get that in under a minute").

Then the steps, counted out loud, three at most. Every step is a physical action a person could do with their hands right now: name the action, then name the one thing people get wrong at that step. A step that is advice rather than an action is not a step — cut it and give its time to the ones that are.

The product enters at the step where it is actually used, doing the job that step needs, and earns exactly one line on why this one rather than another. It is never step one, which reads as an ad, and never the only step that matters.

Finish on the visible result: what they should be seeing or feeling if they did it right, and what it means if they are not. The lesson has to be worth watching even if they never buy — that is what earns the buy. Fold the call-to-action into the last step so the video never stops teaching in order to sell.`,
  grwm: `FORMAT — GRWM / ROUTINE: the ad happens inside a routine that was already running, and the routine never stops for it.

Open mid-task, mid-sentence, hands busy — and give the routine a real destination and a real clock ("I have got twenty minutes before I have to leave", "night shift again"). A routine with somewhere to be is a routine; a routine with nowhere to be is a demo with a bathroom in the background.

Talk the way people talk while doing something else: half-sentences, an aside, losing the thread and picking it back up, saying something to the room. The talking happens around the task — never a piece delivered to camera while the hands happen to be moving.

The product shows up at the exact point in the routine it would really be used, taken from wherever it actually lives (a shelf, a bag, a drawer), and earns exactly ONE line about why it stayed in the routine. Not what it does — why it survived ("this is the only one I have ever re-bought").

Never stop the routine to sell it, never turn to camera to present it, and never restate the benefit later. The call-to-action is an aside on the way out of the door, one sentence at most, said while still doing something else.`,

// ── The hook contract, per style ──
//
// A style instruction describes the whole script, and the model read it as
// something the BODY does: pick "3 Reasons" and the takes came back with three
// counted reasons under an opening line that never mentioned a list, so the
// viewer met a listicle they were never told to expect. The hook library is the
// other half of the cause — it is 8 families of generic openers, and nothing
// tied the family it hands over to the structure the member picked.
//
// So each style states what its FIRST LINE has to establish, and that is what
// picks the formula (see HOOK_OPENING_INSTRUCTION). One line each, describing
// the job rather than dictating wording: a fixed opener per style would make
// every take of that style start the same way, which is the one thing this app
// spends three parallel takes avoiding.
//
// The counting clause on `listicle` and `tutorial` is deliberate and belongs to
// the hook, not the body — a hook that promises three and a body that delivers
// four is the same broken promise as a hook that promises nothing.

  podcast: `SCENE STAGING — PODCAST CLIP: stage every scene inside ONE podcast recording session, cut the way a real multi-cam episode is cut. Two people sit across a table with large boom-arm microphones in frame, headphones on or slung round the neck, warm practical lighting, a dressed background (acoustic panels, a shelf, a plant, a lamp).

[CHARACTER] IS THE GUEST — the expert — and is the only person in the ad with an identity. THE HOST IS THE SECOND PERSON AND THEY DO SPEAK: stage them from behind, over the shoulder, or cut off at the edge of the frame, so what is in shot is a shoulder, the back of a head, a hand resting on a mic — never their face, never a name, never an age, gender, or wardrobe beyond a plain silhouette.

Cut it the way an episode is really cut: the host's question runs over an over-the-shoulder framing past the host onto [CHARACTER], and the answer sits on a clean chest-up studio angle of [CHARACTER], with a second angle roughly 45 degrees off to the side for the cut inside a long answer. [CHARACTER] talks to the host, never into the lens.

Attribute the two voices separately — The host asks: "..." for the host's line, [CHARACTER] says: "..." for the guest's — and give the host a one-clause voice note in the scene where they speak, since the VOICE PROFILE at the end describes [CHARACTER] alone.

[PRODUCT] sits on the table between the microphones from the first scene, unremarked, and gets picked up mid-answer, turned once and put back down. It is never held up to the lens and never presented. One scene may be a tight insert of hands and [PRODUCT] on the table while the answer continues over it.`,
  interview: `SCENE STAGING — STREET INTERVIEW: stage every scene outdoors in the SAME public place on the same afternoon — one stretch of pavement, one market, one park path, one shopfront — in daylight, with real passers-by and traffic behind. A handheld microphone enters frame from the edge of the shot, held by an interviewer who stays off camera and is only ever an arm and a microphone; give them no identity detail at all. The camera is handheld at eye level with a little natural drift, framing whoever is speaking from the chest up with the street legible behind them.

EACH SCENE IS A DIFFERENT PERSON, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE FORMAT: several strangers stopped in the same hour, never one person filmed from several angles. [CHARACTER] is ONE of them — the one whose reaction lands the ad — and ONLY their scenes carry the token. Every other respondent is a plainly different person described by two or three generic markers and nothing more (a rough age band, a build, what they are wearing or carrying), never a name and never a face described in detail.

NEVER WRITE [CHARACTER] FOR ANYONE ELSE. That token is a reference-image slot, so every scene carrying it comes back as the same face — put it on all of them and the vox pop becomes one person in four coats. A scene whose speaker is not [CHARACTER] attaches no character reference at all.

Hold the location, the light and the lens identical across all of them so the cuts read as one afternoon; the only thing that changes is who is standing there.

THE TURN HAPPENS ON CAMERA. A doubt scene is a person mid-shrug, eyebrows up, still holding whatever they were carrying, weight on one foot, half-turned as if they were about to walk on. A reaction scene is that same person a beat after trying [PRODUCT] — the eyes going, the second look down at what is in their hand, the involuntary laugh, the "again?" reach. [PRODUCT] is handed in from off frame by the interviewer at the moment it is tried, and stays in that person's hands afterwards.`,
  'green-screen': `SCENE STAGING — GREEN SCREEN REACTION: stage every scene as a green-screen reaction. [CHARACTER] stands or sits in the foreground to ONE side of the vertical frame, the same side in every scene; the rest of the frame is filled by the thing being reacted to, rendered as a flat on-screen graphic behind them.

RENDER THE ARTIFACT, NOT A CAPTION. Whatever is on screen is a screenshot of a real thing and must look like one: a review card with its star row, a username and a date; a comment with a handle and a like count; a forum post; a price tag or a receipt line; a headline with its publication. Write the exact wording, keep it SHORT (a line or two, large and legible), and keep it inside the middle band of the frame, clear of the top and bottom eighth where the platform's own UI sits.

[CHARACTER] plays to the panel: they turn to look at it, gesture back at it, read a fragment off it, react to it with their face. The graphic CHANGES between scenes as the argument moves — a new piece of evidence each time it is quoted, written out in full in that scene — while the framing, the wardrobe and the lighting stay identical, so the cuts read as one continuous take.

[PRODUCT] comes up into the free hand when it enters, held at chest height on the empty side of the frame so it and the graphic are legible at once.`,
  reply: `SCENE STAGING — COMMENT REPLY: stage every scene as a reply filmed wherever this person happens to be — a parked car, a kitchen counter, the end of a bed, a desk — framed tight and casual from chest height about an arm's length away, lit by a window or a lamp in the room. Hold the same setup, wardrobe and light across every scene so it reads as one sitting; only the framing, the posture and what their hands are doing change.

THE COMMENT IS ON SCREEN AND IT IS PART OF THE PICTURE. Every scene that references it renders it as a comment card pinned in the upper middle band of the frame — a small avatar circle, a handle, and the comment text — and the wording is written out EXACTLY THE SAME in every scene it appears in, so the card does not change between cuts. One short legible line or two, clear of the top and bottom eighth of the frame where the platform's own UI sits.

[CHARACTER] plays to it: glancing up at it, pointing back at it, reading a fragment off it, reacting to it with their face. They never talk as though it is not there. The card may come off for a scene that is pure answer, and it comes back for the closing line that answers the question a second time.

[PRODUCT] is reached for from just outside the frame at the moment it is named, and held at chest height in the same frame as the comment card, so the question and the answer are visible at once.`,
  expert: `SCENE STAGING — EXPERT EXPLAINER: stage every scene in the professional's own workplace — a treatment room, a workshop, a kitchen pass, a salon chair, a workbench — with the tools of that trade visible around them and the wardrobe of the job on. Lighting is whatever that room really has, never a lit set.

Hold a steady, unhurried frame from chest height, and cut to tight inserts of the hands demonstrating the thing being explained. [CHARACTER] is DOING the job while talking — working on a real object, a real surface, or a stand-in for a client — never a scene of somebody standing still describing something. Where the explanation has a mechanism, one scene shows that mechanism happening in close-up on the real thing rather than being described over a talking shot.

[PRODUCT] sits among the professional tools from the first scene, treated as one of them, and gets picked up in the scene where it is recommended — used the way the job uses it, never turned to face the lens.`,
  tutorial: `SCENE STAGING — HOW-TO / TUTORIAL: one scene per step, and every step is shown being DONE. Shoot the steps overhead or over the shoulder, on the hands and the surface, and cut back to a chest-up frame of [CHARACTER] between them.

Each step scene catches the physical action in motion — the pour, the wipe, the click, the fold — with [PRODUCT] in the hands at the step where it is actually used. Where a step names a mistake, that scene shows the mistake being avoided (the hand stopping short, the second pass, the correction), not a diagram of it.

Leave the real clutter of the room in frame; nothing is styled or cleared, and the surface carries whatever was already on it. Hold the same room, wardrobe and light across every step so the steps read as one sitting. The final scene is a tight shot of the finished result, held long enough to be judged.`,
  grwm: `SCENE STAGING — GRWM / ROUTINE: every scene sits inside the routine and the routine never stops. A bathroom mirror, a bedroom, a kitchen at the hour this would really happen, with the props of that hour around it — a towel, a kettle, a half-packed bag, the coat already over the chair.

[CHARACTER] is always mid-task, hands busy, talking while doing — never standing still to deliver a line and never turning to present anything. Hold one fixed camera position they move in and out of, cut with close inserts of the task itself, and let time move FORWARD across the scenes: hair goes from wet to dry, the bag fills, the light in the window shifts. Two scenes that could have been filmed in either order are the same scene twice.

[PRODUCT] enters at exactly the point in the routine it would be used, taken from wherever it lives — a shelf, a bag, a drawer — used for what it is for, and left where it lands.`,

The take's anchor then decides what that other opening is ABOUT — the host asks their question about the take's pain point, the comment doubts the take's benefit, the thing on screen attacks exactly what this take is defending, the first stranger's doubt is doubt about the take's anchor.

// with one, reading "cite these concrete specifics instead of vague claims".

// data with no job. So the steer now rides on the two fields a direct response
// script is actually built from, the spec line says what a spec is FOR, and
// Benefits moved up next to Pain Points — the two halves of the one argument
// ANGLE DISCIPLINE asks for are read together rather than either side of USPs.

// took Key Specs' place and inherited its label, plus the weighting the field
// now carries.

// usable thing in the prompt, and it wins on availability. Reported from

// and its SHAPE was the thing to adapt, and instead the take opened on a
// product hook angle and the source's structure was gone. REMIX_SOURCE_FIDELITY
