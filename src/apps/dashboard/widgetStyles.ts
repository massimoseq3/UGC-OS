// The macOS widget material, in one place. Everything on the Dashboard desktop
// — stat widgets, the Academy link, the Next Steps card, the desktop icons —
// is cut from it, which is what makes the surface read as one system rather
// than a page of cards.
//
// Three layers do the work: a translucent fill over the wallpaper, a
// backdrop-blur so the blooms behind bleed through, and a 1px inner top
// highlight that gives the glass an edge to catch light on. Light mode swaps
// the fill to white and drops the highlight for a soft drop shadow — a dark
// translucent tile on a bright wallpaper reads as a hole, not a pane.
//
// These live beside Widget.tsx rather than in it: a file that exports both a
// component and a plain constant loses React Fast Refresh, and every edit to a
// widget would full-reload the page instead of hot-swapping.
