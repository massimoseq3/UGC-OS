// What's New — the desktop's one feed of things that happened OUTSIDE the
// member's own work: Massimo's YouTube channel and the operator's
// announcements, in the wall's right-hand column.
//
// It was the Announcements tile (August 2026) and took the videos in alongside
// them in September 2026 (Massimo's call) — the channel is where the training
// actually lands, and a member on the Dashboard every morning is the audience
// for it. They share one tile rather than taking one each because the wall is
// a fixed set of tiles — and one PANEL as well as one tile: an announcement
// row is the only thing in the app that opens `AnnouncementsPanel`, which is
// what `buildFeed`'s guarantee below is protecting.
//
// **A few rows with big pictures, not many rows with small ones** (Massimo's
// call, and the shape this landed on after three others). Three truncated
// rows in a single-height tile read as a list you scan past; a full-width 16:9
// hero with a See All under it spent a whole column on one video; the entire
// eleven-video log at 53px a thumbnail fit, but at that size the picture is a
// swatch and the row is really just its title. The thumbnail is the thing that
// makes someone click, so it gets the space: five rows, 124px of picture each,
// and no date — a video from July is not more or less worth watching for
// saying so, and the column it took came off the title.
//
// The tile is a plain widget, not a button: every row is its own control, and
// a button can't legally contain either an <a> or another button.
