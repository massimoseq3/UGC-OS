              **Three columns, rearranged September 2026 (Massimo's call).**
              The two figures stack down the LEFT (Money saved over Time
              saved, the pair that read as one comparison), Activity heads the
              MIDDLE with the Academy link under it, and What's New takes the
              whole RIGHT column at two rows tall. The Streak ring went with
              that rearrangement — the menu bar's flame chip still carries the
              number, and the ledger still feeds it.

              What the tall column bought is the point of it: a full-width
              16:9 hero is 196px, which does not fit in a 233px tile with a
              label, a title and a button. See WhatsNewTile.

              **Below `lg` it is a bento, two tiles across** (August 2026).
              Every widget was `col-span-12` there, so a phone got a stack of
              full-width slabs and the Dashboard became a page you scroll
              rather than a desktop you look at. What's New is the one
              exception — it keeps the full width, because its hero IS a
              full-width picture — and it takes `order-last` so the phone
              still ends on it rather than splitting the four figures around
              it. `auto-rows-fr` is `lg:` only for the same reason: equal rows
              are what make the desktop read as a wall, and below it they
              would squeeze the hero into a figure tile's height. Activity
              earns a half tile by dropping to `PHONE_WEEKS` columns of
              smaller cells (see ActivityHeatmap). */}
