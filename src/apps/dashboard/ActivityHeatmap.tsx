// ran 26 columns back, which at the tile's own width drew cells too small to
// read and spent most of the picture on months a member has stopped thinking
// about — the recent run is the thing this widget is looked at for. Thirteen
// columns fill the same box at roughly twice the cell size.

  // The grid SIZES ITSELF to whatever tile it is dropped in: every column takes
  // `flex-1 min-w-0` and every cell `aspect-square w-full`, so the blocks come
  // out as big as the row allows and the picture ends where the tile does. It
  // drew at a fixed 11px per cell above `sm` until August 2026, which made it a
  // fixed-size object in a fluid box — a dead margin down its right wherever the
  // tile was wider (reported as "a massive gap" the moment the legend that had
  // been filling it came out) and an overflow scrollbar wherever it was
  // narrower. Both were the same bug.
  //
  // `max-w` is the one limit: 13 square cells with no ceiling would be ~24px
  // each in a full-width tile, and the grid's HEIGHT follows its cell size, so
  // the whole wall's second row would grow with the window. Capped, a wide tile
  // centres the grid instead — even margins, which read as placement where a
  // one-sided margin reads as a gap.
  //
  // From `lg` the cap reads the HEIGHT too (September 2026). There the wall's
  // rows take their height from the window, and Dashboard hands this grid a
  // box that is a size container, so a column is capped at whichever is
  // smaller: 24px, or a seventh of the box's height less the gaps (six 3px gaps
  // plus the 4px `pb-1` = 22px). The grid fills the tile on a tall window and
  // gives way on a short one, instead of holding both rows at the 234px its
  // fixed 18px cells used to need. `cqh` resolves against that box only; below
  // `lg` it is not a container and the 18px cap stands.
  //
  // There are no month labels. They were a 9px row over the grid, and at
  // thirteen columns the picture is a quarter and reads as "the recent run"
  // rather than as a calendar to find a date in.
