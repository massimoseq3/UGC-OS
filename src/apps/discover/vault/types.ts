// The Outlier Vault — a curated library that ships WITH the app.
//
// Deliberately not a `DiscoverResult`. A search card is a live row off a
// vendor: signed urls that expire, stats pulled minutes ago, a platform whose
// quirks the normaliser has to hide. A vault row is the opposite — a static
// entry harvested once, carrying the two things a search result never has (the
// hook line lifted out of the transcript, and the reusable template behind it)
// and missing the ones it always has (views, shares, saves, a playable video).
//
// Built by `scripts/build-vault.py` into `public/vault/library.json`.
