/**
 * The vault's landing screen: the library as folders you open.
 *
 * It replaced a segmented toggle that sat above the grid with All selected, so
 * the trade is deliberate and worth writing down — arriving on hooks put
 * something worth stealing on screen immediately, arriving on folders says
 * what the 872 rows actually CONTAIN before asking anyone to scroll them.
 * Two things keep the old speed within reach: **All Outlier Videos leads the screen**,
 * so the previous landing is one click and always the first click available,
 * and typing in the header's field skips this screen entirely (a query is a
 * request to see hooks, not folders).
 *
 * Folders are derived from the rows, never hardcoded — a corpus rebuild that
 * adds a category grows this screen on its own, exactly as it grows the Hook
 * filter. Note the category folders sum to 866 rather than 872: six rows carry
 * no category at all, so they live in All Outlier Videos and belong to no folder. That
 * is the harvest being honest; don't invent an Other folder to make it tidy.
