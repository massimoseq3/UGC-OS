// audience (views ÷ followers) and is comparable ACROSS accounts, which is what
// a keyword search needs — thirty cards from thirty strangers.
//
// Browsing one account asks a different question: which of THIS creator's reels
// popped? A 200k-view reel is a flop on an account that does 400k as a matter
// of course and the find of the month on one that does 20k. So a card on that
// tab is scored against the median of the reels around it.
//
// The two never share a grid. The Accounts tab shows one account at a time and
// states its baseline in the header directly above the cards, so the amber
// badge still means exactly one thing everywhere it appears — the header says
// which denominator produced it. Mixing both ratios into one grid is what the
// badge rule exists to prevent, and nothing here does that.
