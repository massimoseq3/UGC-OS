// UGC ad style/format presets surfaced by PresetPicker. Each preset drops a
// *universal* style prompt into the prompt box — it describes only the shot,
// framing, camera, angle, movement and vibe of the format, never a specific
// subject, product, room, decor or props. The user supplies their own
// reference images for the actual scene, so the prompt must not fight them.
// Any content the user should customise is left as a [bracketed placeholder]
// they fill in or delete (e.g. what they're reacting to, the topic, the task).
// The same set is offered in both Video and Image mode (style is format-
// agnostic). Thumbnails are bundled from ./assets/presets so they ship
// statically.
