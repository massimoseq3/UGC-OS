// One photo's trip from data URI to stored asset, remembered by the exact bytes
// it came in as. The product form autosaves, and it adopts the asset ref a save
// hands back through React state — so a debounce that fires in the window
// before that adoption commits offers us the SAME data URI a second time.
// Persisting it twice minted a second asset, which `updateProduct` then read as
// a replaced photo and purged the first for; the form's pending adoption put
// the first ref back on the row, so the second was purged in its turn — and the
// row was left pointing at a blob that no longer existed. That is the
// placeholder card, and it took every angle on the product with it.
//
// The map is per open form (a fresh one each time the form is opened) and holds
// the in-flight PROMISE, not the resolved ref, so a submit racing an autosave
// over the same photo waits on the one save instead of starting a second.
// Keying by the data URI costs nothing — JS strings are shared, so this is
// another reference to bytes the form is already holding.
//
// Every Bank form that takes a picture autosaves now (Characters' portrait,
// B-Roll's still — see `useBankAutosave`), and each has exactly this hazard, so
// `persistImage` is exported for them rather than re-derived per form.
