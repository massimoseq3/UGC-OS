/**
 * The connect-a-key transaction, shared by the ApiKeyGuide modal, the
 * Meet-your-team intro and Settings → API Keys. The rule that has to hold in
 * all three: the key is checked against the live balance BEFORE it is saved,
 * so nothing is ever stored that can't generate. Each surface draws its own
 * markup around it.
 *
 * Settings used to be the exception — a cosmetic 350ms wait, then the write —
 * so a typo pasted there was stored and every app failed on it later with a
 * 401 far from the field it came from. It seeds the draft with the saved key
 * through `setDraft` each time it opens.
 *
 * Lives in its own file rather than inside ApiKeyGuide: a file that exports
 * both a component and a hook loses React Fast Refresh.
