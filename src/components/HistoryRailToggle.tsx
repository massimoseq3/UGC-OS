// The control that OPENS a shut history rail — a 38px circle in the app's own
// icon-button material, laid out rather than overlaid, and WHERE it sits is the
// caller's business: B-Roll's rides inside the storyboard bar, Scripts' and
// Voiceovers' stand in a narrow column where the rail was
// (`HistoryRailClosed`, below).
//
// It only handles the SHUT state (Massimo's call, September 2026). Shutting an
// open rail is `HistoryRailHandle`, the lip on the seam — a tab on the rail's
// own edge, which costs the rail's band nothing and leaves it to its New
// button. The two are split because the seam only exists in one of the two
// states: with the rail gone there is nothing for a lip to be a tab of, and a
// tab on the bare edge of an output column is a mystery button. Shut, this
// says the word.
//
// A pull tab tried to do BOTH jobs for a day and that is what failed: costing
// no layout is worth nothing if the thing it overlaps is chrome, and every one
// of these output columns puts a full-width bar across its own top — B-Roll's
// batch strip, Voiceovers' script picker row — which a shut-state tab pinned to
// the corner landed on. The version before that was a 40px bordered strip,
// which read as a second panel.
