// Everything about a visual style that ISN'T a component: its preview artwork
// and the per-app accent palettes the style cards are painted in.
//
// These lived in StyleModal.tsx alongside the modal itself, which meant every
// host importing an accent also imported the whole modal, and the file exported
// four constants beside its components (which is what react-refresh warns
// about — a module mixing the two can't hot-reload cleanly).

// Preview art for the built-in styles — the same scene rendered in each look, so
// any grid of them reads as one comparison set. Pre-scaled to ~640px JPEG (the
// cards are ~137px wide) and keyed by style id, exactly like the Characters
// preset portraits. Kept out of `utils/visualStyle.ts` on purpose: that file is
// imported by prompt builders and services that have no business pulling
// bundler asset URLs. A style with no entry falls back to the palette glyph.
