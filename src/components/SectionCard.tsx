// the header's left and right edges (Influencers' TabDivider shape, folded into
// the card header rather than sitting on a divider row of its own — a 25%-wide
// pane can't afford a whole row to carry two 10px pills).

// built from, a stack of delivery settings. Don't card a lone control — the
// border is what says "these belong together", and around a single row it says
// nothing while costing 24px.
