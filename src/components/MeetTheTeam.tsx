// NO EM DASHES IN THIS SCREEN'S COPY. Massimo's call (August 2026): this is
// the introduction, and it should read like someone talking rather than like
// something written. Use a comma, a colon or a full stop. It applies to every
// string this file RENDERS, which includes the team blurbs in utils/team.ts —
// they surface here and nowhere else. Comments are prose about the code and
// are not covered.
//
// "Meet the team" — the first thing a new member sees. Auto-opens once per
// browser (appStore.teamIntroOpen), reopenable from the wordmark.
//
// It does two jobs, in this order:
//
//   1. Teach the production line. Characters → Scripts → Voiceovers → B-Roll →
//      Edit is the pitch, so it's staged as a row of five crew cards with the
//      flow running left to right, with Bank and the two on-call tools on a
//      quieter second line. It used to be a call sheet — eight rows, eight
//      blurbs — which is a reading task, not an introduction. The blurbs now
//      live in ONE caption slot under the row that follows the cursor, so the
//      screen stays scannable and the copy is still a hover away.
//
//   2. Take the kie.ai key. Nothing in the workspace can generate without one,
//      and this used to be a footnote pointing at Settings — so the member left
//      the intro with the one blocking task undone. The field is here now, on
//      the same verify-then-save path as the ApiKeyGuide (useKeyConnect), and
//      the screen won't pretend the crew is ready until it's filled.
