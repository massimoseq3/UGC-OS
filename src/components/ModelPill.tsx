// The model that produced a generation, as one small pill — the app's only
// "which model made this?" idiom on a finished output. In-flight surfaces
// (GeneratingMedia, GeneratingTile, the in-flight list rows) name the model in
// their own layout and are deliberately NOT routed through this: they are
// reporting on work in progress, not labelling a result.
//
// Three surfaces:
//   `media`  — sits ON a still or clip. Literal white-on-black, per the overlay
//              exception in CLAUDE.md; no backdrop-blur, because these pills
//              fade in/out with their card's hover and blur stutters under an
//              opacity transition (same reason TileActionStack drops it).
//   `chrome` — sits on a panel surface beside the meta pills, one step brighter
//              than they are: the model is the answer being looked for, the
//              resolution and aspect are the fine print.
//   `quiet`  — no pill at all: dim text, for a caption line UNDER a card where
//              the model rides beside a label of its own (B-Roll's "Option 2"
//              line). A chip there would be a second badge on a row that is
//              already the card's quiet footnote.
//
// Renders nothing when the model is unknown or the member has turned generation
// info off.
