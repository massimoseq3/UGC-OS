// The voice profile box — WHO is speaking, as opposed to what is on screen.
// **One component, two hosts**: Playground's video tab, where it is appended to
// the end of the prompt at generate time (`composePrompt.ts`), and B-Roll's card
// detail modal, where it is the ad's one shared dialogue voice. It was two
// separate boxes until September 2026 (Massimo's call) — the same control, a
// dock tile apart, with different chrome, different padding and the preset
// picker on only one of them.
//
// It is exactly what a member was doing by hand: the profile is the one part of
// a UGC video prompt that must NOT change between generations — the same person
// has to speak in every clip of an ad — so it was being pasted back under every
// new prompt, two lines down, and re-selected around every time the prompt was
// rewritten. Keeping it in a field of its own means the prompt box holds only
// the shot, and the voice survives Clear, Enhance, Undo and a whole new idea.
//
// Nothing is added around it. What gets sent is the prompt, a blank line, then
// this text verbatim — "as if you'd typed it on the end" is the contract, and a
// label we invented here would be a word in the prompt the member never wrote.
//
// **In Playground it is video only** (and not Motion Control, which has no audio
// at all): a voice has nothing to say about a still or a music track. In B-Roll
// it renders on a DIALOGUE card's Video / Animate tabs, for the same reason.
//
// **The header row folds it.** This is a set-once field sitting in the panel's
// tightest column, directly under the prompt box it steals height from — so once
// the profile is in, the box is 90px of something nobody is reading. Folded it
// keeps one truncated line of the profile, which is what says it's still on; a
// fold that hid the text entirely would read as the voice having been cleared.
//
// It starts OPEN. The box is the reason the card exists, and folded-by-default
// meant a member who had never opened it had never seen what goes in it. It
// costs 78px in the one column that has none spare (this sits directly under a
// prompt field whose own floor was cut to 150px to keep it and its toolbar on
// screen at all), which is exactly what the fold is for: one click puts it away,
// and where the host persists the flag the member pays that price once rather
// than every session.
//
// **The header carries no status pills.** B-Roll's copy wore an `optional` and
// an `every clip` pill either side of the title; both came off with the merge
// (Massimo's call) — everything in these columns that isn't marked otherwise is
// optional, and what "every clip" was saying is said properly by the host's own
// placeholder, in a sentence, inside the box it describes.
//
// There is deliberately **no Clear button**: this is a plain textarea, emptying
// it is select-all-delete, and a destructive control on a set-once field is one
// misclick from re-pasting a paragraph. The References card's Clear exists
// because attachments can't be deleted by typing.

// Where the box stops growing and starts scrolling: THREE lines, and then the
// field scrolls itself. `AutoGrowTextarea` caps only a paste box with no natural
// ceiling, which is what this is — it sits directly under the prompt box and
// takes its height out of it, so a profile typed out long must not push the
// thing you actually write in off the column.
//
// It was 120px (~six lines) until September 2026 (Massimo's call): a profile is
// two or three sentences and a set-once field growing to half the column as you
// type it reads as the box running away with the panel. Three lines is enough to
// see the whole of a normal one, and the fold is what puts a long one away.
//
// The number is generous by a few px on purpose. A phone floors every field at
// 13px (`index.css`), and the `plain` shell adds its own bottom inset — so the
// cap has to clear 3 × 19.5 + 2 or the third line is clipped into a scroll on
// exactly the width where it should fit. Four lines is over it in every case.
const MAX_FIELD_HEIGHT = 62

// ACCENT is what the list is sectioned by, so accent is what the rail
// navigates: three groups, each worth scrolling to. GENDER is the filter that
// cuts across all three, centred on the toolbar above them — two values, which
// is a pill row rather than a rail. Both used to be dropdowns side by side, and
// the pair was tried the other way round for a day (gender in the rail) before
// landing here (Massimo's call, September 2026).

// `section` is B-Roll's card detail modal: a real `SectionCard`, centred heading
// over a hairline, and the card's own rectangle as the field. `plain` is
// Playground's input column: no rule, its own tighter padding, and the field as
// a bordered box inside it.
//
// They were tried as ONE shape (September 2026) — the `section` one, in both —
// and Playground was put back the way it was on sight (Massimo's call). The two
// live in different places: B-Roll's is one card among several in a modal, where
// the hairline is what every neighbouring card draws, and Playground's is the
// last thing in a cramped input column directly under the prompt box, where the
// rule is one more horizontal line in a stack that already has too many. So the
// difference is deliberate, and a caller picks the one its column is built from.
