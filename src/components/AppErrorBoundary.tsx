/**
 * The reason nothing in this app goes white any more.
 *
 * A React error thrown with no boundary above it unmounts the entire tree, and
 * the commonest one here isn't a bug at all — it's a deploy. Apps are lazy
 * chunks, a deploy renames them, and a tab that was open across it asks for a
 * file that no longer exists the moment the member opens an app they hadn't
 * opened yet. That threw inside <Suspense>, took the whole workspace with it,
 * and left a blank page that only a manual refresh explained.
 *
 * Wrapped per app pane, the blast radius is that pane: every other app stays
 * mounted with its work intact, and the member reloads when they're ready. The
 * same boundary sits at the root as a floor under everything else.

    // August 2026). So the second signal decides it too: if the version poll
